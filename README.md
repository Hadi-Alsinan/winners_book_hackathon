## Introduction

"أصيص" is an innovative project that blends the love of reading with the care for plants. It targets readers who are passionate about sharing their knowledge with those who care. "أصيص" is a unique mix of future technologies and the spirit of knowledge. It features a plant pot integrated with electronic components that enable it to communicate with its dedicated app over the internet. This allows the user to be the sole source of nourishment for the plant by entering the name of a book, page number, and a quote. Consequently, the pump will automatically water the plant, symbolizing the nourishment of the mind with knowledge and wisdom. "أصيص" encourages reading through a comprehensive platform that brings together diverse readers.
